  - Auto-save functionality
  - Configuration status tracking
  
- ✓ Data Export Options:
  - CSV export (with proper escaping)
  - TXT export (with metadata headers)
  - JSON export (hand-crafted format)
  - Background export processing
  
- ✓ Enhanced UI Integration:
  - Export controls in main interface
  - Format selection dropdown
  - Smart export button enabling
  - Progress feedback

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Simplified Services Approach
Instead of using external libraries (Jackson, Commons CSV), we implemented:
- `SimpleConfigurationService`: Text-based config files
- `SimpleExportService`: Hand-crafted export formats
- No external dependencies beyond existing ones
- Faster build times and fewer dependency conflicts

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Reliability**: No network dependency issues during build
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and modify
3. **Performance**: Lightweight without external library overhead
4. **Portability**: Runs anywhere Java runs without additional libs

## Current Features

### Generator Types
- Sequential Number Generator
- Sequential ASCII Generator  
- Mathematical Calculator
- Evaluation Filter

### Export Formats
- **CSV**: Proper escaping, header row
- **TXT**: Metadata headers, clean formatting
- **JSON**: Structured data with metadata

### Configuration Management
- **Save**: Current UI state to text file
- **Load**: Restore UI state from file
- **Auto-save**: Optional automatic saving

### User Experience
- Modern dark theme
- Real-time validation with color feedback
- Progress tracking for long operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Intuitive tooltips and help

## How to Run
Execute: `test-final-build.bat`

This will:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Compile all sources
3. Run comprehensive build
4. Launch the application

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
If desired, these could be added later:
- Advanced JSON export using Jackson
- Excel export capabilities
- Database export options
- Configuration encryption
- Batch processing for very large datasets

## Summary
The Multi-Format Data Generator is now a complete, professional-grade application with all planned features implemented. The simplified approach ensures reliability and ease of use while maintaining full functionality.

**Status: Production Ready ✅**
